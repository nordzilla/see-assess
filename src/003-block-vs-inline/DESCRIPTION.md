# Block vs. Inline

Two of the most basic display types are `block` and `inline`. 
Block elements are each displayed on a new line whereas inline
elements are placed on the same line.

In HTML, many elements have default associations for how they are
displayed. For example, paragraphs `<p>` are `block` elements by
default and italics `<em>` are inline by default.

However, it is important to note that the display type of an element
is ultimately determined by the applied style, and CSS can override
these defaults.
